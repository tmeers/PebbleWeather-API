PebbleWeather-API
=================

Simple server to return weather data to a Pebble device from forecast.io. Will be used in my fork of the robotoweather watch face.
https://github.com/tmeers/pebble-robotoweather

Initial stage:
  - App will only pull data and send down to client
  
Stage two:
  - Well I'm jsut not sure yet. 
  - Maybe anon location saving to city level?
